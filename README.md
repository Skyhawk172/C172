# C172 Performance Calculator


## Summary 

This Python code calculates various quantities for a Cessna 172M 1976 with a
180-HP engine conversion. The performance quantities are based on the Pilot
Operating Handbook tables, which are interpolated to almost any values based on
user inputs. 


## Input File Description

The performance tables are actually hard-coded in the Python script. The only
external file necessary for running this script is the "airport.csv", which
should be updated or downloaded from http://ourairports.com/data/.



## How to Run

To run the script, simply call: python C172_performances.py AIRPORT_ID1 AIRPORT_ID2
